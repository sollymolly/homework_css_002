### Homework Assignment - CSS Practice

CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. You may not know many of CSS properties and syntax, but if you google your questions, you will be able to find all the answers you are looking for.

**What to do:**

- Fork https://github.com/geekdojo-io/homework_css_002 to your GitHub.

- Redo the "Available Dogs" page (`/dogs/index.html`). Use Internet such as [www.herdofwy.com/availabledogs.html](http://www.herdofwy.com/availabledogs.html) as an example.
- Complete styles.css based on the questions below.

**Homework**

Open the homework-css_002 using `Brackets` app. It should be found in your Linux virtual machine. 
Open the file `dogs/index.html`. 

* Here, you are creating a fake dog rescue page that shows picture of available dogs and some descriptions. 
* Have at least 3 dogs on the page, one has to be *Herb*
* Use `CSS` and `HTML`.
* Keep it simple. Don't make the contents and page structure overly complicated.

* Here are some examples I found in the Internet:
